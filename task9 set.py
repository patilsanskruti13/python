# ðŸ”¹ Set Tasks
# Create a set of 5 numbers and print it.
# Add a new element to a set and remove an existing element.
# Write a program to find the union and intersection of two sets.
# Create a set and check if a particular value exists in it.
# Convert a list with duplicate values into a set and display the result.
# Write a program to find the difference between two sets.
# Create two sets and check if one is a subset of the other.
# Remove all elements from a set using a method.
# Find the maximum and minimum values from a set of numbers.
# Use a set comprehension to create a set of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
