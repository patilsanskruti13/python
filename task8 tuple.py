# ðŸ”¹ Tuple Tasks
# Create a tuple of 5 different fruits and print the first and last elements.
# Write a program to find the length of a tuple without using len().
# Concatenate two tuples and display the result.
# Create a tuple with mixed data types (string, int, float, list) and print each element with its type.
# Write a program to check if a given element exists in a tuple.
# Convert a tuple into a list, modify one element, and convert it back into a tuple.
# Create a nested tuple and access an element from the inner tuple.
# Find the index of a given element in a tuple.
# Count how many times a specific value appears in a tuple.
# Unpack a tuple into individual variables and print them.
